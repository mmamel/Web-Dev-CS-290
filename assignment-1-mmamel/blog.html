  <p>My biggest challenge completing this assignment was understanding how<br>
     Git worked. The only experience I had with Git/GitHub was just to <br>
     upload code I had done so others could view it online. It took me some<br>
     time to get used to the proccess of git add into git commit into git push. <br>
     I had the most trouble with git pull because I have two devices that I code<br>
     on so I ran into some merging bugs. </p>
   <p>Because I had completed some free online html courses prior to the course,<br>
      I was familiar with the basic tags and layout of html code. The only resources<br>
      that I used was the W3schools website to remember the exact names of the tags<br>
      and the exact syntax, like how to write the img tag.

    <p>I had a lot of trouble with positioning the boxes and flexboxes. The <br>
      most problematic issue was when I tried to line up the left border column <br>
      containing the update button, with the results section. I solved this by <br>
      making the boxes inline and adjusting the padding accordingly.</p>
    <p>I learned how to manage the layout of elements in a responsive manner using<br>
      the position property and flex boxes. I already knew about styling text but <br>
      what I didn't know was that the button could be styled into a circle and expanding<br>
      the plus sign</p>
      <p>The resources that I used were the class notes as well as W3School. These provided<br>
        all the documentation I needed to be successful</p>
        <p> To complete this assignment, I had to google how to manage the size of the container<br>
          so that I could make all the images uniform</p>
